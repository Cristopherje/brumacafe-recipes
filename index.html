        <h3>The Perfect Espresso Shot</h3>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          Espresso is the foundation of almost every coffee drink. It is a
          concentrated form of coffee, served in small, strong shots. A perfect
          shot should have a rich flavor and be topped with a golden-brown foam
          called "crema".

        <h3>The Creamy Mocha</h3>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          A mocha is the perfect marriage between coffee and hot chocolate. It
          combines the intensity of espresso with sweet chocolate syrup and
          steamed milk, often topped with whipped cream. It is a dessert-like
          treat for coffee lovers.
